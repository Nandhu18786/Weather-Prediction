# Weather Data Fetching and Temperature Prediction

## Overview
This Streamlit-based web application fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and predicts future temperatures using a linear regression model.

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data for a given city.
- Displays weather parameters like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- Predicts future temperatures using linear regression.
- Provides a user-friendly interface with Streamlit.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Requests
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nandhu18786/Weather-Prediciton.git
   cd Weather-Prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Enter the city name in the input field.
3. View the real-time weather data and predicted temperature trends.

## API Key Setup
To use the OpenWeatherMap API, obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and set it in your environment:
```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```
Or set it directly in the script:
```python
API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
```
